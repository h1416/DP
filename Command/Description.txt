The Intent:
	1. Represent an action as an object
	2. Decouple clients that execute the command from the details and dependencies of the command logic
	3. Enables delayed execution
		a. Can queue commands for later execution
		b. If command objects are also persitent, can delay across process restarts

Also known aas: Action, Transaction

Applicability:
	1. Logging
	2. Validation
	3. Undo

Consequences
	1. Commands must be completely self contained
		The client doesn't pass in any arguments
	2. Easy to add new commands
		Just add a new class (open/closed principal)
